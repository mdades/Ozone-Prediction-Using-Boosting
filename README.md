# Ozone-Prediction-Using-Boosting
This academic project, carried out during the Master’s program in Statistical and Stochastic Modeling at the University of Bordeaux (2024–2025), focuses on the boosting of statistical predictors and its application to the forecasting of atmospheric ozone concentrations. The objective was to compare different regression methods—namely multiple linear regression, penalized regression (Lasso), and a Boosting-type iterative model—to identify the most efficient approach for predicting the maximum hourly ozone concentration based on meteorological and pollutant data collected in Périgueux between November 2023 and November 2024. The dataset included over 8,000 hourly observations and 27 explanatory variables, such as temperature, humidity, wind, NOx concentrations, and atmospheric pressure. A thorough data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted, including the removal of irrelevant or incomplete variables, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. For the multiple linear regression, variables were selected using correlation analysis and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to improve interpretability. The Lasso regression was implemented to perform automatic variable selection and regularization, optimizing the penalty parameter λ through cross-validation. The Boosting approach was designed as an iterative additive model, where at each step the algorithm selected the variable most correlated with the residuals and fitted a simple linear model, progressively reducing prediction error. Each method was evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² on both training and test sets, with additional analyses on a reduced sample to assess overfitting and robustness. Results showed that the Boosting model achieved competitive performance with a clear interpretability of selected variables, while the Lasso regression provided the best trade-off between accuracy and model simplicity, highlighting the most influential predictors such as NO, NO₂, humidity, and pressure variation. This project demonstrates how iterative variable selection and ensemble learning techniques like boosting can significantly improve predictive modeling in environmental applications, offering valuable insights for air quality forecasting and public health planning.
